== Eliding Memory-Management Fences on Making PTEs Valid (Svvptc)

When the Svvptc extension is implemented, explicit stores in a hart that update
the Valid bit of leaf or non-leaf PTEs from 0 to 1 are ordered before, and
become visible to, implicit references in that hart to the memory-management
data structures by instructions subsequent to a memory-management fence
instruction, or an `SRET` instruction, or `MRET` instruction, whichever occurs
first after the PTE-updating stores.

[NOTE]
====
Commonly, PTEs are marked as Valid by an OS in response to a page-fault
exception or a system call, such as one that maps memory regions. In such
scenarios, the trap handler typically uses an `SRET` to return from the trap.
The store operations used by the trap handler to update the Valid bit of the
PTEs from 0 to 1 are ordered before and visible to the implicit references to
the updated memory-management data structures by instructions subsequent to the
`SRET`, such as the instruction that raised the page-fault exception or the
instructions that access the newly mapped memory ranges. A memory-management
fence is not necessary in such cases.
