== No Invalid PTEs in Adddress-Translation Caches (Svvptc)

When the Svvptc extension is implemented, explicit stores in a hart that update
the Valid bit of leaf or non-leaf PTEs from 0 to 1 are ordered before and
visible to implicit references in that hart to the memory-management data
structures by instructions subsequent to a memory-management fence instruction
or an `__x__RET` instruction, whichever occurs first after the stores that
update the PTEs.

[NOTE]
====
This extension effectively prohibits the caching of a PTE in address-translation
caches if the Valid bit of the PTE is clear. Consequently, updating the Valid bit
from 0 to 1 for either leaf or non-leaf PTEs does not require a memory-management
fence to invalidate cached copies of them from any address-translation cache.

Commonly, PTEs are marked as Valid in response to a page-fault exception or a
system call, such as one that maps memory regions. In such scenarios, the trap
handler typically uses an `__x__RET` to return from the trap. The store operations
used by the trap handler to update the Valid bit of the PTEs from 0 to 1 are
ordered before and visible to the implicit references to the updated
memory-management data structures by instructions subsequent to the `__x__RET`,
such as the instruction that raised the page-fault exception or the instructions
that access the newly mapped memory ranges. The use of a memory-management fence
is not necessary in such cases.
